# task

A Custom Library is made for the provided Task using Java Language.

The library made can be used in any java project just by importing library.

Currently Map Function is made. Map function is used in Separate test project, which is also uploaded.
[UPDATE] reduce and filter functions are also included now.
Map function accpets input of array/list in both Integer and string format.
If you provide List of Integers it multiplies each value by itself and same is done with string type. 
Major implementation is done in Library Class.

[UPDATE] {
Filter function is currently filtering on the basis of odd or even numbers.
Three subroutines of Reduced function is done 
i)concatination of the array
ii)reduced addition of the array
iii)reduced multipliction of the array
Library Class also implements a MapFunction Interface, where Map functionality is overrided.
Similarly with the others
Major Library Structure along with three function has been completed.

It is implemented using Netbeans IDE.
Please let me know if you need complete project for verification.
I am further working on remaining functions.
