# task

A Custom Library is made for the provided Task using Java Language.

The library made can be used in any java project just by importing library.

Currently Map Function is made. Map function is used in Separate test project, which is also uploaded.

Map function accpets input of array/list in both Integer and string format.
If you provide List of Integers it multiplies each value by itself and same is done with string type. 
Major implementation is done in Library Class.

Library Class also implements a MapFunction Interface, where Map functionality is overrided.

Major Library Structure along with first function has been completed.

It is implemented using Netbeans IDE.
